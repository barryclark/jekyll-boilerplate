I have a Masters in Computer Science from Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) and have been working in the ML/DL field for close to 5 years now.  Previously, I have worked with two startups Teradeep and Nirveda Cognition. I am currently working as a Deep Learning Engineer at Center for Deep Learning in Electronics Manufacturing [CDLe](https://cdle.ai/), where I work on applying DL to solve challenging problems in semiconductor manufacturing. My work at CDLe tackles the fundamental challenges involved in applying DL to semiconductor domain problems where data is scarce. I have developed sample efficient DL algorithms using synthetic data and DL algorithms for image registration. I am an instructor who co-created a course curriculum to teach Deep Learning at CDLe
