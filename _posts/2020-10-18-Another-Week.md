title: Another Week 
---

I have a Biology Unit Test on Tuesday about the basics of genetics—mitosis, meiosis, DNA, inheritance, that sort of thing. I generally study for these things by taking light notes on the study topics in the days beforehand, then on the day before the test, I start to take really in-depth notes reviewing every single topic, and I usually spend three hours doing that. Maybe it’s not efficient, but I find that it really helps me with memorization. 

One thing I am frustrated about is my lack of coding progress. Every time I try to get into programming, it will go well for a period of weeks, and then I’ll suddenly lose all interest and pursue other things. This has been happening for maybe four years now, so that I’ve learned only the rudimentary concepts of Python. I wouldn’t know how to use arrays to save my life, unfortunately, even though I’ve tried learning them at least five times now. 

Another thing I’m disappointed about is the Model Rocketry club I was planning on starting this year. It appears that I won’t be able to do that, since much of the work required to build rockets needs to be in-person. Maybe I’ll be able to start it next year? 

This week’s book recommendation is _A Study in Brimstone_ by G. S. Denning. It made me laugh really hard, and I hope you will too—especially at the bit where they talk about Americans industrializing the crumpet.
