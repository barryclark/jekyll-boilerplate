The word 'chaos' is used in the Cynefin framework to describe a domain where the agents of a system have no constraints. While the chaotic domain can be a bad place to be, in the right circumstances it can be used to fuel innovation. Liz Keogh has previously posted about [isolated idea generation](https://lizkeogh.com/2015/03/09/the-shallow-dive-into-chaos/) and Cognitive Edge have developed a pattern called [Ritual Dissent](http://cognitive-edge.com/resources/basic-methods/) in order to perform a 'shallow dive' into chaos. In this post I'd like to talk about how hack days can be used to do this, provided certain precautions are taken.
