title: A Trip to Cambridge
---

Yesterday, I went to Cambridge and attended a rocket launch held by the Cambridge Rocket Club. I brought my rocket. 

Because I was an idiot, I didn’t capture the footage of my rocket’s flight, so you’ll never know how it looked, but it was one of the most pleasurable experiences I’ve ever had in my life. It was equipped with an A3-8 motor, so it didn’t fly very high and came down very quickly, but it was beautiful nonetheless. 

I also took the GO Transit for the first time in my life. The bus fare was murder, but it was also a double decker bus, which meant that I had the most amazing time sitting atop the universe.

This week’s book recommendation is _Black Dragon River_ by Dominic Ziegler. He has a way with words that compartmentalizes specific imagery into the equivalent of visual haikus.
