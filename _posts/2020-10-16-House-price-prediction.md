title: House Price Prediction Competition
---


The AICVS club hosted a competition based on Deep learning and computer
vision on the Kaggle interface on 4th October, 2020. The participants were
supposed to submit their entries from 00.00 a.m. to 11.59 p.m., after
solving the dataset remotely on their laptops.

The competition was about predicting the prices of houses in Boston based on
different parameters using Linear Regression. For this, we had to use the
Boston Housing Dataset from Kaggle.

During these trying times, AICVS has tried to ensure that we provide quality
content and ample learning opportunities for everyone , no matter their skill
level. To make sure that everyone was on the same page , tutorials for people
new to Machine Learning and Kaggle , were provided.

The winners of the competition were

<ol>
<li> 1st: Vaishnavi Khilari  , Score : 3.69578</li>
<li> 2nd: Sejal Kshirsagar  , Score :  3.89530</li>
<li> 3rd: Nupur Shah  , Score :  3.94156</li>
</ol>

When Vaishnavi was asked to give some tips for beginners, she said "<em>Firstly, I
would suggest them to learn Python as mostly the code demonstration is done
in Python. If anyone is searching for online resources or courses, I would like to
suggest them to take the Caltech Tele Course, in which ML has been explained
really great, theoretical. And for a hands on experience, take the Andrew Ng's
course. Be curious and practice by yourself as much as you can.</em>"

We would like to thank the participants for showing so much vigor and
enthusiasm for the Kaggle competitions hosted by us. We hope to bring you
many more competitions like this.

Till then keep practicing :))
