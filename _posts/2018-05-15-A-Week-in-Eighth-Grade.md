title: A Week in Eighth Grade

Hi. This is Amely typing.

Well, okay, I guess it would be hard for anyone else to be typing this.
In Science, we’re having a project done for our Science Fair in June. After some discussion, we decided to go and blow up stuff at a friend’s house using common household materials, or rather, just the ones that we could find in his garage. Beforehand, I did some research on what not to mix together, otherwise it could kill you. Apparently, you shouldn’t mix bleach with ammonia or vinegar. I hope that most people have realised that it is a bad idea to mix bleach with anything else in any case. Drain cleaners are apparently also dangerous, though I don’t see why mixing baking soda and vinegar together is. (The one downside of mixing the two together is that they neutralise each other, so neither is good at cleaning anymore.)

In History, we are writing essays on different treaties in Canadian history, which is giving everybody a lot of stress. 

In Math, we are wrapping up a unit on Measurement and Geometry.

For French, we are exploring a unit with the theme of food, and also writing a short jeu de role, where we are pretending to be enjoying the cuisine of a particular French-speaking country in a restaurant. Our little group is exploring Louisiana, and at the moment are trying to find a drink special to the region. It’s a very interesting place to find yourself looking at food. Alligator meat is apparently traditional; our French teacher tells us that it tastes like chicken. (It’s interesting, because whenever I ask about a foreign meat, people tell me it tastes like chicken.) It’s a little hard to find a drink that doesn’t involve alcohol, because my partner wants to make the food as an extra. He is very enthusiastic about finding a way to make a non-alcoholic version of drinks like the Sazerac or the Hurricane.

Gym is gym. I’ve never been crazy about it, but I don’t exercise enough (or so my sister tells me) so it’s a welcome part of the week.

We just wrapped up a presentation for Music looking at the different ‘founding’ genres of Rock music. My group was contrasting Blues and Jazz. I didn’t know that stringed instruments are often used in Blues because the African slaves who began Blues had to make their own instruments. 

Outside of school, I am trying to learn programming with Python, and I feel like I am completely rubbish at it. I’m still trying to get the hang of programming with the Turtle module using the Python For Kids book, which I’d recommend to anyone trying to learn Python. There’s also a PDF online, and a website.

My book recommendation of the week: The Inquisitor’s Tale, by Adam Gidwitz, or The Three Magical Children and Their Holy Dog. (The author spent six years researching it!)
