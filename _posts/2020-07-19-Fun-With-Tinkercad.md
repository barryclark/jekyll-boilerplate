title: Fun With Tinkercad
---

It’s been a while since my last post! As expected, lots of things have happened since then. For one thing, I am now in tenth grade. Well, eleventh grade as of September…

This year, I took a course in Computer Engineering. It was one of the best courses I have ever taken, because the teacher was excellent and the subject was fascinating. I had a marvelous time fiddling with small wires and creating functioning circuits, which was absolutely beautiful. 

Unfortunately, I took the course from September to January (2019 to 2020) and now it is July. I forgot a lot of things, and now I’m looking to relearn them a little before taking the Grade 12 Computer Engineering course next year. 

I thought I would try using Tinkercad’s circuit simulator for a little extra practice, and then this happened:

As you can see, the LED (red one) up top is lighting up, but not the one on the bottom (the green one). I thought I had it rigged up all right, but on an iPad it seems impossible to actually push a pushbutton, so it wouldn’t light up. Go figure. 

Unless I’ve done something wrong with the circuit, which would be just embarrassing… 

This week’s book inspiration is Siddhartha Mukherjee’s _The Emperor of All Maladies_. I never thought you could get so much information about cancer in one place.
