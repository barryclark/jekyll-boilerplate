title: Possibly the Humble Beginnings of a Model Rocketry Hobby
---

One thing I’ve always wanted to do but never really dedicated myself to is model rocketry. Yesterday, I finally plucked up the courage to email somebody who is a part of NAPAS (North American Propulsion and Aerospace Society) to ask for recommendations regarding beginner rocketry. 

His first recommendation was to start small and use ¼ A or ½ A motors, which are easy to fly safely. I still have no idea what either of those motors is (I think they have different amounts of thrusting power?), so I will have to do some work regarding that. 

I was also told to read the Handbook of Model Rocketry from cover to cover, so I am getting started on that now. 

I’m starting to feel intensely overwhelmed by the upcoming horrific subject of university applications, and the sheer amount of work I have to do to properly learn everything I need to so that I can do whatever I want when I get older. Also, I am terrified that my family will murder me for my laziness. There’s so many things I have to do… 

Eh. I think I might try starting a Model Rocketry club at my school next year, if everything works out and I become organized enough. 

I also started picking up rudimentary ASL for fun. It’s actually quite interesting. 

This week’s book recommendation is _Eight Days of Luke_ by Diana Wynne Jones.
