title: Vehicle Detection and Identification in satellite imagery
---

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/vedai_instance_segmentation.png)

Implement and train Convolutional Neural Network to detect vehicles in satellite imagery.
Once the vehicles are detected, they are further identified based on their type
i.e whether it is a car, truck, pick up, van, tractor, boat, plane, camping car etc.
