Happy Mid-Autumn Festival! 

Yesterday, the new Shang-Chi comic series finally launched, and I was grateful for it for a multitude of reasons. 

The first was that I didn’t know a single thing about him, and I needed to brush up on his lore for the upcoming film (which I am very excited about). The second is that he’s a _Chinese superhero_. The third is that he hasn’t gotten an excessive amount of character growth compared to the other big names in the Marvel Universe. Look at Hulk—he practically gets a new book about him every other week! And during that time, Bruce Banner’s roots are explored, he gets to go to space, he falls in love—all the things, basically. 

And Shang-Chi? He seems to be toted around solely for the sake of having Asian representation whenever all the superheroes get together. 

I quickly went through quite a few of the comics that he’s been in for the past nine years, and honestly, he hasn’t been through very much. There was the comic series he got for himself in 2014, but that was written by a white dude, and then there was that really weird solo series from 2011 or so where he grows four extra arms out of nowhere. Other than that, he’s been involved with the Avengers, Iron Fist, and the Agents of Atlas (of course), taking relatively minor roles. Then there was that one time he met Domino, which was actually a nice four-issue run, because it showed off a side of him I hadn’t seen before. The romance was a little weird, but that’s probably because I haven’t ever gotten the chance to see him playing a romantic role. Any other appearances he makes are essentially him punching people in a support role while the main characters of the respective series he’s guesting in beat up the real big bads. 

And no, I didn’t look at the comics from the 1970s, because then I’d probably work myself up into an even longer rant. 

So yes! Bring on the new solo series! I love seeing him finally being brought into the modern era of Marvel comics, and being given the respect that he has long been due. 

I have been taking Biology for the past month, and I’ve surprised myself with how much I’ve been enjoying it. I thought it would be a slog trying to memorize all the terms (which it is), but I seem to be doing alright so far. French has actually become a little tedious, the opposite of my expectations, which worries me. Hopefully I find something to sink my teeth into that will bring me out of this slump. 

This week’s book recommendation, is, obviously, the first issue of _Shang Chi (2020)_, written by Gene Luen Yang. Go check it out!
