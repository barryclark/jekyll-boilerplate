Implemented entire system from scratch using non deep learning methods for Math Symbol Recognition.
The data contained x, y co-ordinates obtained from stylus strokes on the tablet.
Random Forest, Minimum Spanning Tree and Edmond's Line of Sight algorithm was used to classify,
combine and parse strokes to recognize mathematical expressions
