The session started with information about the **Eaton Pratibha Excellence Award**. Pratibha -Eaton Excellence award is a unique program that aims at encouraging multifaceted women engineering talent in India through an educational scholarship at both graduate as well as post-graduate levels. It’s a scholarship that aims to recognize exceptional women engineers in leading engineering institutions in our country. Assessing them based on academic excellence as well as co-curricular achievements. It’s based on the motive: *‘Power of Perspectives’*.

Three students from each college get the benefits of this scholarship. The Selection Process is based on your excellence in academics (CGPA), your involvement in community services like working with NGOs, contribution towards society; and your co-curricular achievements. Even though there is a certain CGPA criterion your application does not solely depend on CGPA or academic merit.

*‘Practice’* is the key to prepare for an internship or placement. Research about the company before the interview and always find the common type of questions asked.

Revisit your previous interviews in your mind. Dig deeper into what went wrong or how you could have articulated it. Practice your technical and non-technical skills from various sites.
