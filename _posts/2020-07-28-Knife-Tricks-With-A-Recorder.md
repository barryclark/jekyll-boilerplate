title: Knife Tricks With a Recorder
---

I got bored today, so I decided to try and learn how to twirl knives. Unfortunately, none of the knives I had at home suited my hand, so I had to use a recorder instead. Happily, the recorder was the recommended twelve inches, so I promptly got to work. 

So far, I have learned how to reverse the grip on the knife and how to spin the ‘knife’ between my fingers. Here’s the grip reversal:

And here’s the twirling:

This week’s book recommendation is _High Rise_ by J. G. Ballard. It genuinely disturbed me.
