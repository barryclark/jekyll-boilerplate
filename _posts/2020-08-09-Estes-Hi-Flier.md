title: Estes Hi-Flier

Well, a week later and I found an old Estes Hi-Flier my sister gave to me four years ago! Perfect timing, and it provided a source of entertainment for the past week. 

Here’s the rocket as it’s being built:

![Part 2]({{site.baseurl}}/images/FCC3F236-C78D-4318-B443-6BB851E5FB66.jpeg "Part 2.")

![Part 3]({{site.baseurl}}/images/A89B1E91-5F0F-4203-9008-E574811053D6.jpeg "Part 3.")

The one on the bottom is the finished product. 

I’m also trying to learn how to do a backflip. 

This week’s book recommendation is _1984_ by George Orwell.
