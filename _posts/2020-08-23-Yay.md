Learning how to get the graph of a function from the graph of its derivative. I was being stupid, so I thought that if the graph of the derivative rose, then so would the graph of the function. I ended up getting a lot of questions wrong before finally figuring it out and feeling like an idiot. 

Another week has gone by. Yay. 

Book recommendation of the week: _The Devil All The Time_ by Donald Ray Pollock. I felt like I was chewing on sand while reading the book, the texture was _that_ well developed.
