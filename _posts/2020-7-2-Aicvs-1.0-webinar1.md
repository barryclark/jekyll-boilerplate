title: AICVS 1.0 - How to pursue Research as an Undergrad
---	


AICVS hosted its Webinar Series AICVS 1.0 with its first session on 30th June 2020 on **“How to pursue Research as an undergrad”**. The speaker for the 1st webinar was our former Head Co-Ordinator  Michelle Davies Thalakottur. Michelle is currently a final year student of Computer Engineering in our college. She has done a research internship at IIT Patna in Summer 2019 on ‘Machine Learning and Dimensionality Reduction’. She has also published three papers as a co-author over a span of 6 months. Currently, she is a summer research intern at IIT Bombay and is working on ‘Program Analysis and Points-to analysis’. Michelle is passionate about student outreach. In this session, she articulated about pursuing research internship as an undergrad and also shared her personal experience during her research work.

The session began with the quote **“Survivorship bias is real”**. Survivorship bias is a common logical error that distorts our understanding of the world. 
It happens when we assume that success tells the whole story and when we don’t adequately consider past failures.

### What is Research?

Research is driven by curiosity and the desire to expand knowledge. It’s a process of systematic inquiry that entails collection and documentation of information with analysis and interpretation of that data. Michelle described research as *innovation and learning at its purest*. She explained it through the following diagram:

Assume that the big circle encompasses entire human knowledge and the blue circle is what you learn in school. The orange circle is what you have learned till 12th. The green circle is the undergraduate course you are currently pursuing. The narrow yellow circle is a specialization or masters in a particular field. What it means to do research is to break the circumference and think what lies beyond what is already known by mankind. Research is to *Think out of Box* and explore things beyond the outermost circle.

There are mainly two spectrums of research: Incremental and Fundamental

- *Incremental Research*: Build on current body of work, incrementally. 
Ex: You can change a small part of an algorithm or you find some new interesting results.

- *Fundamental Research*: Experimental or theoretical work performed to obtain new findings on the basis of observable facts, without prior consideration that it will result in any practical application or use. It’s the research that causes destruction. 
Ex: Albert Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity.

Michelle then briefed about *Why you should consider research?*
1. Useful in campus: The ability to do research shows an ability to learn, apply and present your knowledge.
2. Masters and PhD program admission: The more competitive the program, the more they value research. Doing research is not must for many programs, but if you really have an eye for it, you must go for it.

Michelle further briefed about *Common Misconceptions on Research*:
1. You need to be Smart!  NO. You should be passionate, driven and committed towards your work.
2. You should know what field you want to work in from its inception!  NO. You can change your field, if you find that a particular field does not excite you.
3. You need to be a genius or an IITian or well connected to do Big-Brain Research.

And to this Michelle said: 
> ‘YOU ARE WHAT YOU TELL YOURSELF. DON’T HOLD YOURSELF BACK.’

She emphasizes on the fact that **‘Research is fun, intellectually stimulating and enriching’.**

Can you become an independent research undergrad? Well, you can but there are many predatory journals. Publishing is a tricky business; it can take years to publish a work because they need quality than quantity. Publishing in certain places can also lead to disqualification. Research is a marathon and not a race.

Being an undergrad, you have to first bridge that gap between an undergraduate and the circumference; and then break out of it. You need a professor with good research experience and work. Quality work requires hard work, time, devotion, expertise and commitment.

### How to choose a domain and Hot vs Not-So-Hot topic?

Before applying for internship explore various domains that excites you. Conceptualize your thinking. Be passionate and ready to explore all the avenues. Michelle also talked about topics that are Hot vs one that are Not-So-Hot. There are a few disadvantages in both the cases. If you choose a Hot Topic there’s a possibility that you may get a fancy professor but has no time for you. There’s oversaturation and many people do fake research which leads to quality degradation. If you select Not-So-Hot topic; no one talks about it. The impact is harder.

Michelle’s Advice: Go for things that interests you; realize that it should be sustainable.
Expectations from yourself: A certificate, paper, exploring and learning your domain topic deeply. As an undergrad you can’t contribute until you give enough time. You have to be committed towards your work.

Expectations from a Professor: _Guidance, resources and time_.

Getting a research internship is not based on merit or CGPA. You have to reach out to professors and show your interest. Michelle also talked about approaching professors to know about their work domain, research and methodology. She also mentioned that students can ask for referral from our college professors. Avoid sending cold emails to professors, you might get a professor who has no research credentials or has no time.

Her advice on cold email is to read professor’s papers and get to know more about their work domain before emailing them. Ask them about their work and be reasonable. You have to spend time before internship to build your domain knowledge and also never stop believing in yourself.
Some resources for research: connectivity, build relationship with seniors, join clubs, approach professors.
