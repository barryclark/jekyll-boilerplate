Over the course of the semester in 'A History of Words,' students will learn a variety of digital skills that they will then apply to a source that they have selected from Princeton University's [digital special collections](https://dpul.princeton.edu).
Working in groups of two or three, students will decide how best to craft an explanatory narrative about that source through digital media using whatever digital tools or skills they desire. Check back in May 2021 to see their work linked here!
