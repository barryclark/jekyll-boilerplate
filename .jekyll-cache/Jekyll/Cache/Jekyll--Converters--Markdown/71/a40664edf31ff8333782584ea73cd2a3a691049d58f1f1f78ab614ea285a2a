I"˜<p>I was excited to begin this digital tools assignment because of the StoryMaps format, and I was happy to start delving into the 19th century American West. I decided that for this project I wanted to explore some of the broader pieces of American Manifest Destiny. Since I knew that I wanted my topic to be connected to the journal that I plan to use in my final project, I began by scanning and reading the 1853 <a href="https://dpul.princeton.edu/pudl0017/catalog/qr46r491g">journal of Thomas Adams</a> from the beginning, jotting down locations he mentioned as I read (if you want to learn more about this source, you can read my previous post <a href="https://hum-331-princeton.github.io/Go-West-Young-Man/">here</a>). The best part of this stage was frantically searching the names of rivers and lakes, since those were the most frequently referenced landmarks. It got a little tricky for the pages when he was in Minnesota, though‚Äì they don‚Äôt call it the ‚ÄúLand of 10,000 Lakes‚Äù for no reason!</p>
