  <p>This unknown region had long attracted me. With a desire to know more about the country extending from the McKinley range of Mountains to the Southern Coast, we determined to explore the valley of the Great Shushitna and its principal tributaries, which drain thousands of square miles in the very heart of Alaska. - Nellie Martin Wade, “Through Interior Alaska on Horseback and The Scenic Coast Route”</p>

<p>For this digital tools assignment, I chose to explore the <a href="https://findingaids.princeton.edu/collections/C0140/c65810-06143">manuscript</a> by Nellie Martin Wade that I discussed in my <a href="https://hum-331-princeton.github.io/Thinking-About-Sources-and-Methods/">last post</a>. This manuscript includes a highly organized narrative of Wade’s trip to Alaska in 1907, whose goals and motivations are described in the above quote. I was particularly struck by the language and poetic tone of Wade’s writing. I wanted to find a way to capture her descriptions and express them through images by mapping out the journey she describes in her journal. Along this goal, I hoped to contextualize her journey and better understand what external factors might have led Wade to visit Alaska, as well as who else came to Alaska before Wade.</p>
