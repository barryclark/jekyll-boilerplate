<p>For my project, the basic topic that I want to look into is activism on college campuses, perhaps solely focused on Princeton. I am interested in this topic partially because I am involved in some activism on campus and also because lots of movements have ties or roots in college campuses. As a result, I believe that looking at activism on campus can also be a good way to see beginnings of and the progression of liberal ideas in society.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/ed/18/08/student-activism-20">article</a> explains the importance and history of student activism which gives more context for my above statements.</p>
