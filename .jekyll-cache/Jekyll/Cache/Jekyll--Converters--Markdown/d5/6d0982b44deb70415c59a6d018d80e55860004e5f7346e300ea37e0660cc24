<p>For my project, the basic topic that I want to look into is activism on college campuses, perhaps solely focused on Princeton. I am interested in this topic partially because I am involved in some activism on campus and also because lots of movements have ties or roots in college campuses. As a result, I believe that looking at activism on campus can also be a good way to see beginnings of and the progression of liberal ideas in society.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/ed/18/08/student-activism-20">article</a> explains the importance and history of student activism which gives more context for my above statements.</p>

<h2 id="sources-used">Sources Used</h2>

<p>Through the university‚Äôs finding aid website, I noticed that the university has a lot in the archives on campus activism.</p>

<h2 id="these-resources-largely-fall-under-these-three-categories">These resources largely fall under these three categories:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>meeting notes and pamphlets of activist clubs on campus
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://findingaids.princeton.edu/collections/AC437/c2">finding aid source example</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>oral histories with students about their experiences
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://findingaids.princeton.edu/collections/AC259/c66">finding aid source example</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>official documentation from Princeton administrators commenting on activism
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://findingaids.princeton.edu/collections/AC255">finding aid source example</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I would also be interested in contacting the special collections librarians to get their advice on other sources I could use as I am sure there are a lot.</p>

<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>

<p>As of now, I have a lot of thoughts on potential options for what my project will look like. I am not sure which of these options will be the most feasible so this is basically just a list of my brainstormed ideas</p>

<ol>
  <li>Timeline mapping out major activist events and what documents found say about each</li>
  <li>Map of campus with major events described and linked to particular location</li>
  <li>Creating op-ed style articles on sources found in order to mimic styles often used by activist to explain and explore material</li>
</ol>

<p>I am hoping that viewers of these sources will get a better understanding of the rich history of activism on campus and what individuals protested for and what they were like generally.</p>

<p>In terms of challenges, I expect that finding in-depth sources where people are being authentic will be hard. Additionally, finding ways to integrate all the sources into one final project will be hard.</p>
