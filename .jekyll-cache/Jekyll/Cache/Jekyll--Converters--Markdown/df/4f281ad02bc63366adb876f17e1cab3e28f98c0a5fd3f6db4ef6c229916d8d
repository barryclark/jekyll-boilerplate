<p>The sources that I am considering using are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>First, a collection of Japanese Board Games dating from the 19th century and first half of the 20th century that can be found in the PUL <a href="https://dpul.princeton.edu/cotsen/browse/japanese-game-boards">Japanese Game Boards</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, I am also considering using Japanese Portraits from the 18th and 19th century that can be found in the PUL <a href="https://dpul.princeton.edu/ga_treasures/browse/japanese-and-chinese-prints-and-drawings-donated-by-gillett-g-griffin">Japanese and Chinese Prints and Drawings Collection</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>
