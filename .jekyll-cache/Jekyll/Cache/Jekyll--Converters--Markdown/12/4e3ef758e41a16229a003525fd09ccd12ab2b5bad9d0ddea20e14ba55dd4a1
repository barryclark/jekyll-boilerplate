I""<p>The Princeton University Library’s <a href="https://papersofprinceton.princeton.edu/princetonperiodicals/?">Papers of Princeton</a> collection offers a rich trove of multiple historic publications from Princeton — both the town and the university. A dive into this collection allows one to reconstruct life in Princeton as far back as the mid 1800s through records detailing everything from the biggest events of the day to the most mundane. In fact, the collection’s comprehensive nature even allows one to construct partial narratives of individual students’ lives in some cases. And in the case of famous alumni, this collection often contains a second story, not of a student’s life as much as of a student’s accomplishments and legacy.</p>

<p>Take, for example, Michelle Obama</p>
